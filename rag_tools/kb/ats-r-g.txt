ATS-Friendly Resume Guide:
1. Use Simple Formatting:
* File Format: Save your resume as a .docx or .pdf file to ensure compatibility with ATS.
* Fonts: Use standard, easy-to-read fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Avoid fancy fonts or excessive formatting.
2. Include Relevant Keywords:
* Job Description: Tailor your resume to each job application by incorporating keywords from the job description.
* Skills: Highlight relevant skills and qualifications prominently. Use industry-specific terminology where appropriate.
3. Use Standard Sections:
* Header: Include your name, contact information (phone number, email address), and LinkedIn profile URL at the top.
* Summary/Objective: Provide a brief summary of your experience and career goals (optional but recommended).
* Work Experience: List your work history in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Include job titles, company names, dates of employment, and key responsibilities.
* Education: Include your highest degree obtained, institution name, graduation date, and relevant coursework or honors.
* Skills: Create a skills section highlighting technical skills, certifications, and languages relevant to the job.
* Additional Sections: Add sections such as Volunteer Experience, Certifications, Projects, or Professional Development if relevant.
4. Bullet Points and Keywords:
* Use bullet points to describe your work experience and achievements.
* Start each bullet point with action verbs (e.g., managed, developed, implemented).
* Quantify achievements where possible (e.g., "Increased sales by 20%").
5. Avoid Graphics and Tables:
* ATS may have trouble reading graphics, images, tables, or text boxes. Keep your resume layout clean and straightforward.
6. Proofread Carefully:
* Check for spelling and grammar errors. ATS may reject resumes with spelling mistakes.
