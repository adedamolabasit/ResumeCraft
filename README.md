# ResumeCraft

ResumeCraft is an advanced platform that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance resumes for job applications.

## Project Description

### AI-Powered Platform

ResumeCraft is an advanced platform that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance resumes for job applications.

### Tailored Resumes

The platform customizes resumes to match specific job descriptions, ensuring they align with the keywords and format preferences of ATS.

### Personalized Cover Letters

In addition to resumes, ResumeCraft generates personalized cover letters that highlight the candidate's strengths and suitability for the job.

### ATS Analysis

ResumeCraft provides an analysis of the resume's ATS compliance, offering insights and suggestions to improve its chances of passing through ATS.

### User-Friendly Interface

The platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible for job seekers at all levels of expertise.

### Efficiency

By automating the resume tailoring process, ResumeCraft saves time and effort, allowing job seekers to focus on other aspects of their job search.

## How It Works

### Upload Process

Users start by uploading their existing resume and the job description they are targeting to the ResumeCraft platform.

### AI-Driven Generation

ResumeCraft's AI analyzes the uploaded documents and generates a new resume tailored specifically to the job description. This includes optimizing the format, incorporating relevant keywords, and emphasizing the most pertinent experiences.

### Custom Cover Letter Creation

The platform also creates a customized cover letter that complements the tailored resume. The cover letter is designed to highlight the candidate's unique qualifications and fit for the role.

### Fit Analysis

ResumeCraft conducts an analysis to determine how well the tailored resume aligns with the job description. It provides feedback on areas of strength and suggests improvements.

### Improvement Highlights

The platform highlights what has been improved in the resume, making it easy for users to understand the changes and the rationale behind them.

### Download and Apply

Once the resume and cover letter are finalized, users can download them and proceed with their job applications, confident that their documents are optimized for success.

## How It's Made

### Generating the CID

The resume file and job description are sent to a Flask server from the frontend. The server processes and indexes these files, then saves them to Pinata, a decentralized storage system. The CID generated by Pinata serves as the knowledge base for the AI.

### Backend (Flask/Python)

Backend Code Repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your-repo)

### 1. Update Knowledge Base

To run the AI agent, we first update the knowledge base dynamically with the `setKnowledgeBaseCid` function in the smart contract. This function takes a Content Identifier (CID) as an argument and updates the knowledge base accordingly.

```solidity
function setKnowledgeBaseCid(string memory cid) public {
    // Update the knowledge base with the new CID
}
2. Running the Agent
With the knowledge base updated, the runAgent function is called to start the AI agent. The initial prompt is parsed into the function, and the AI uses the data from the knowledge base to generate responses.

Iterations
First Iteration: Generates the tailored resume.
Second Iteration: Generates the personalized cover letter.
Third Iteration: Runs competency analysis and ensures ATS compliance.
solidity
Copy code
function runAgent(string memory initialPrompt) public {
    // Parse initial prompt and start AI agent
}
3. Monitoring the Agent
To check if the run is successful, the isRunFinished function is called. This function verifies whether the agent has finished running.

solidity
Copy code
function isRunFinished(uint256 runId) public view returns (bool) {
    // Check if the agent has finished running
}
4. Retrieving Results
Once the agent has completed its tasks, the getMessageHistoryContents function is called. This function retrieves the responses for the particular runId, providing the generated resume, cover letter, and analysis results.

solidity
Copy code
function getMessageHistoryContents(uint256 runId) public view returns (string memory) {
    // Retrieve the responses for the specified runId
}
